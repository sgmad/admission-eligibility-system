# Simple University Admission System

A simple, console-based Python application that simulates a university admission system. This program allows a user to add applicants, view their details, check admission status based on set criteria, and view a summary report.

This project was built to demonstrate fundamental Python concepts, including:
* Functions
* Lists and Dictionaries
* Loops (nested `for` and `while` loops)
* Conditional Statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`)
* Robust Input Validation with `try-except` blocks

## 🚀 Features

* **Add Applicants**: Add multiple applicants with their full name, age, entrance exam score, and interview score.
* **Input Validation**: Includes nested `while` loops to ensure that age and scores are entered as valid, positive numbers.
* **View All Applicants**: Displays a clean, formatted list of all applicants currently in the system.
* **Check Admission Results**: Automatically processes each applicant based on the following admission criteria:
    * **Age:** 18 or older
    * **Entrance Exam:** 80 or higher
    * **Interview Score:** 75 or higher
* **View Summary Report**: Provides a statistical summary including:
    * Total number of applicants
    * Number of accepted applicants
    * Number of rejected applicants
    * Overall acceptance rate (%)
    * A list of all accepted applicants by name

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

You only need Python 3 installed to run this program.

1.  Clone this repository (or download the `Lastname_admission.py` file).
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    # Make sure to replace "Lastname_admission.py" with the actual file name
    python Lastname_admission.py
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to use `python3` instead of `python` depending on your system's setup.)*
